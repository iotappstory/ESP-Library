/*
  The IOTAppStory-ESP library uses wifimulti internally and takes care of:
  - Managing & storing multiple credentials
  - Automaticly connecting to the strongest AP from the list on boot
  - And optionally: go to config mode if a WiFi connection can not be made

  This often brings up the question: 
  How can I as a programmer take control over wifi in my sketch whithout breaking the builtin options?

  This example demonstrates how to:
  - set whether or not to go to config mode when there is no Wifi connection
  - preSet WiFi credentials (developer mode)
  - set wifi events (callbacks)
  - connect & disconnect from whithin your sketch

  Wifi defines are defined in the config.h file in the IOTAppStory-ESP library folder. And are free to modify.
  DO NOT set these in your sketch. It will not work!
  #define WIFI_SMARTCONFIG            false   // Set to true to enable smartconfig by smartphone app "ESP Smart Config" or "ESP8266 SmartConfig" | This will add (+/- 2%) of program storage space and +/- 1%) of dynamic memory
  #define WIFI_MULTI                  true    // false: only 1 ssid & pass will be used | true: 3 sets of ssid & pass will be used
  #define WIFI_MULTI_FORCE_RECONN_ANY false   // By default wifi multi will only try to reconnect to the last AP it was connectected to. Setting this to true will force your esp to connect to any of the available AP's from the list.
  #define WIFI_CONN_MAX_RETRIES       20      // sets the maximum number of retries when trying to connect to the wifi
  #define WIFI_USE_MDNS               true    // include MDNS responder http://yourboard.local
